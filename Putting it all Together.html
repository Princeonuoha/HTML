	<h2>From Principedia, learning all I can learn about Energy</h2>
	
	
		<p><b>Power-to-gas</b> (often abbreviated <b>P2G</b>) is a technology that uses 
		electrical power to produce a gaseous 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel" title="Fuel">fuel</a>.
		<p>The video below from the IET institute for energy technology shows a systematic
		view of a power to gas system. </p>

		<p>In December 2013, ITM Power, Mainova, and NRM Netzdienste Rhein-Main GmbH began 
		injecting hydrogen into the German gas
		distribution network using ITM Power HGas, which is a rapid response proton exchange membrane 
		electrolyser plant. The power consumption of the electrolyser is 315 kilowatts.
		It produces about 60 cubic meters per hour of hydrogen and thus in one hour can feed 
		3,000 cubic meters of hydrogen-enriched natural gas into the network.</p>

		<p>On August 28, 2013, E.ON Hanse, Solvicore, and Swissgas inaugurated a commercial power-to-gas unit in 
		Falkenhagen, Germany. The unit, which has a capacity of two megawatts, can produce 360 cubic meters of
		 hydrogen per hour. The plant uses wind power and Hydrogenics electrolysis equipment to
		 transform water into hydrogen, which is then injected into the existing regional natural gas
		 transmission system. Swissgas, which represents over 100 local natural gas utilities, is a partner in 
		 the project with a 20 percent capital stake and an agreement to purchase a portion of the gas
		 produced</p>

		<h3>Top 3 facts about power to gas</h3>
		<ol>
		<li>PtG allows the conversion of volatile electricity into renewable, synthetic gases (H₂ or SNG) 
		with an unmatched low carbon footprint which can be stored, transported
		and commercialized for mobility</li>
		<li>PtG decarbonizes the gas grid by replacing fossil natural gas</li>
		<li>PtG adds flexibility to energy systems and therefore enables efficient
		integration of high shares of volatile renewables into energy markets</li>
		
		</ol>
		<p ><a href="https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/"> Global trends</a> </a> within the renewable energy space continue
		to be positive for the growing importance and expansion of PtG.</p>
		
		<p>While PtG technology has been around for some time it is still considered a “new” and disruptive technology.
		Below are just two examples on the use of PtG that provide strong validation for its 
		expanded use&#58;</p>
		
		
			<ul>
			
			<li>In June 2013, Audi announced its opening of a 6-MW PtG 
			facility in Germany making it the first automaker to 
			develop a chain of sustainable energy carriers.</li>
			
			<li>Construction of Japan’s first PtG plant was initiated in July 2017 
			as a key part of its efforts to reduce CO2 emissions.</li>
